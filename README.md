# EHR-analysis
Part 1 attempt 


## Data parsing

Define a function `parse_data(filename: str) -> ???` that reads and parses the data files. Choose appropriate data structures such that the expected analyses (below) are efficient.

Include a module docstring describing your rationale for choosing these data structures.

Include a function docstring analyzing the computational complexity of the data parser.

## Analysis

Define the following functions to interrogate the data. In each one, include a function docstring describing its computational complexity _at runtime_ (i.e. after parsing into the global data structures).
